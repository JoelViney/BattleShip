# BattleShip
A simple implementation the game battleship in C#.

What can I say about this project?
* The internet was down for a couple hours and this was the end result. 
* The application starts in Program.Main(), this helps flesh out and describe the structure of the application.
* The PlayerAction implements a Command pattern.
* This is object oriented, there are no anemic domain models here.
